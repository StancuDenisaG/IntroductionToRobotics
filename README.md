# Introduction To Robotics (2022 - 2023)
Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.

## Homework 1:  RGB led controlled by three potentiometers
**Task Requirements:**
Use a separat potentiometer in controlling each of the color of the RGB led (Red,Green andBlue).  The control must be done with digital electronics(aka you must read the value of the potentiometer with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected to the led).\
